# Project-GIF

Project-GIF allows you to use any of your favourite gifs within your favourite apps. It works as a helper across apps, without taking away your favourite keyboard. 

This is a very early stage of development of the project. Feel free to have a look around, bring up your own ideas as suggestion in the Issues tab, or open your very own PR!

For the time being, the coolest thing I can show you is this sweet GIF I found online! Check it:

Sweet moves indeed!


## How to contribute
Here is how the branches of this project are managed. If you would like to contribute to the project, make sure to follow the following conventions in order to make sure everything get merged properly with as limited conflicts/chaos possible:

* `master` contains the ship-able version of the code. This branch must always be able to compile, and all test must pass! Nothing that is not finished goes to master.
* `feature branches` are branches that are branched off `master`, and implement a new feature or fix a bug.
* Try to keep your PRs as small as possible in order to be reviewed easily. If you believe that your work would be too big for one branch feel free to create new branches off your feature branch. Once done, create a PR to merge your new branches to your feature branch. Once all the smaller branches are merged to your feature branch, create a new PR to merge your `feature branch` to `master`.
